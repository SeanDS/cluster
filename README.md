# Cluster
Geometric constraint solver using cluster rewriting, with support
for non-rigid clusters.

This is based on the paper "[A non-rigid cluster rewriting approach to solve systems of 3D geometric constraints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448509000694)" by
Hilderick A. van der Meiden and Willem F. Bronsvoort, and [GeoSolver](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geosolver/),
a Python 2 implementation of the algorithms contained within that paper.
